1-2 day plan for fixing batch processing.

ðŸŽ¯ Batch Processing Fix - Implementation Plan

Day 1: Analysis & Strategy (6-8 hours)

Morning (3-4 hours): Root Cause Analysis

- Hour 1: Document current crash patterns
    - Run disabled tests to capture exact crash stack traces
    - Identify which llama.cpp functions are failing
    - Map crash points to specific memory operations
- Hour 2: Analyze memory management issues
    - Review llama_batch structure allocation/deallocation
    - Identify sequence ID initialization problems
    - Check for threading/synchronization issues
- Hour 3: Evaluate fix approaches
    - Option A: Fix native batch implementation
    - Option B: Java-level batching fallback
    - Option C: Hybrid approach
    - Document pros/cons and effort estimates for each

Afternoon (3-4 hours): Design Solution

- Hour 4: Choose implementation approach based on analysis
- Hour 5: Create detailed technical design
    - Memory management strategy
    - Error handling approach
    - API interface design
- Hour 6: Create test plan and success criteria
    - Define what "working" means
    - Create test cases for validation
    - Plan performance benchmarks

Day 2: Implementation & Testing (6-8 hours)

Morning (4 hours): Core Implementation

- Hours 7-8: Implement chosen solution
    - Code the core fix (native or Java-level)
    - Add proper error handling
    - Implement memory safety measures
- Hours 9-10: Initial testing and debugging
    - Enable disabled tests one by one
    - Fix immediate issues
    - Validate basic functionality

Afternoon (2-4 hours): Validation & Polish

- Hour 11: Comprehensive testing
    - Test with different batch sizes
    - Test with different models
    - Test multi-sequence scenarios
- Hour 12: Performance validation
    - Benchmark against single inference
    - Verify memory usage is reasonable
    - Document performance characteristics
- Optional Hours 13-14: Documentation and cleanup
    - Update API documentation
    - Clean up debug code
    - Prepare for integration

Success Criteria

- All 3 disabled batch tests pass consistently
- No crashes or memory leaks
- Batch processing shows performance improvement over single inference
- Solution is maintainable and well-documented

Risk Mitigation

- High Risk: Native fix might hit deeper llama.cpp issues
    - Mitigation: Have Java-level fallback ready
- Medium Risk: Performance might not meet expectations
    - Mitigation: Define minimum acceptable performance thresholds
- Low Risk: Integration issues with existing code
    - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with existing test suite

Deliverables

1. Working batch processing (either native or Java-level)
2. Enabled and passing tests (all 3 batch tests)
3. Performance benchmarks and documentation
4. Updated MISSING_FEATURES.md reflecting new status

  ---
Total Estimated Effort: 12-16 hours over 2 days
Success Probability: 90% (with fallback to Java-level implementation)
